# ClipSynth
Light and fast video clips manager for Windows. Depends on VirtualDub, AviSynth and NicAudio.

## Dependencies
1. Obtain VirtualDub and extract it to a `VirtualDub` folder under the `ClipSynth` root folder.
	* The `ClipSynth` root folder is the one that has the `ClipSynth.exe` file.
	* Make sure the VirtualDub files are named `ClipSynth/VirtualDub/vdub.exe` and `ClipSynth/VirtualDub/VirtualDub.exe`
2. Install AviSynth on your computer.
3. Obtain NicAudio and place `NicAudio.dll` in the `ClipSynth` root folder.

## Building Source
Open `ClipSynth.sln` in Visual Studio and build.

## Usage
Run `ClipSynth.exe` and use the images tab and the movies tab for manipulating images and movies using the buttons on the right.

(I'll put up a stable build link shortly.)
